//     **** Compile in windows through windows powershell  **





// after writting the code in visual code go to the folder and 
// goto the source code file(holding shift + right click) and run in windows powershell 
//type (gcc "name of code file") then hit enter, that will compile the code to a .exe file 
//then type the first alphabet of that .exe file and hit tab( " it will autocomplete your .exe file")
//when you compile through gcc again and  again it creates .exe of different names 
//( eg--> a.exe, a1.exe(2nd time),a3.exe(thrd time) for same file)
// if don't want that, u want to save file in one name not different names
// use (gcc -on "code file name")


// **** run .exe file ****
// hold shift + right click to .exe file, it will open  powershell
//just type  that .exe file name(or type the first alphabet and hit tab to auto complete)
//that will run your .exe file in powershell
